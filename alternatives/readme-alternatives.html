<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Alternatives offers two new possibilities to consider when making the decision
    about whether to side with the Shadow Thieves or with Valen's Mistress. In
    addition to the traditional two, the player may now opt to side with a group
    even the paladins in the party could have no objection to... or he may opt
    to skip the whole decision entirely and set sail for Maztica.</p>
  <p>Alternatives
      also offers a different way to satisfy Mae Var's demand that the protagonist
      steal an artifact from a temple and an alternate way to complete the Riddle of the Sewers.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:
    Shadows of Amn, with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. There
    are no known or suspected problems with compatibility. The mod was tested on installations that included <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=128&Itemid=100" target="_blank">Quest
    Pack</a>, and if both mods are used (recommended), Quest
    Pack should be installed first. </p>
	<p>Alternatives is compatible with "Faster Chapter 1&2 Cut-Scenes & Dreams" 
	(component "Convenience Tweaks and/or Cheats") from Tweaks Anthology mod.</p>	
	<p>Please note:</p>
	<p>As of v12, Saerileth mod and Alternatives are fully compatible. For this, Saerileth has to be 
	installed *before* Alternatives so Alternative can patch the IncrementChapter action. 
	If not, it is not possible to accept alternative routes to Brynnlaw for both Saerileth and 
	Alternatives mods, as it will break the chapter numbering of your game!</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
<p><strong>BGII:EE</strong><br />
    If you use BGII Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with 
	<a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">modmerge</a> before
	installing any mods. Also, BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch 
	update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay 
	the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your 
	old savegames. </p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Alternatives is
    packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or any other software capable of extracting RAR archives.
    If properly extracted, you should have an alternatives folder and setup-alternatives.exe
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory. To install,
    simply double-click <strong>setup-alternatives.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on
    screen. </p>
  <p> Please run setup-alternatives.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory
    to reinstall or uninstall components. </p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. Alternatives is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory.&nbsp; If
    properly extracted, you should have an alternatives folder, setup-alternatives,
    and setup-alternatives.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-alternatives.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
      Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg">WeiDU.org</a> and copy
      WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to
      your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries.<br />
    You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran
    it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
    so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
    if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
    name. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the
    safe bet.<br />
    Run WeInstall alternatives in your game folder to install the mod. Then run
  wine BGMain.exe and start playing.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> One of the things that always bothered me (berelinde) is that it is nearly
    impossible for a lawful good character to go through the game and remain
    completely true to his or her alignment. Siding with thieves is not a very
    lawful thing to do, nor is allying with undead a particularly good deed.
    The "Paladin Route" offers a third option, the ability to work for an unimpeachably
    good organization and eliminate two evils. The "Assassin Route" came about
    a bit later, as a result of some musing about how a character who has no
    real interest in either rescuing Imoen or going out of his or her way to
    take revenge on Irenicus might want to avoid the whole decision entirly and
    get the hells out of Amn. Jastey never liked the idea of having to kill Quallo's only friend to obtain Lilarcor, or the concept of stealing prized
    artifacts from temples while running errands for Mae Var, so she created
    workarounds for those, as well. &quot;Temple Thievery Alternative&quot; is incorporated
    in Jastey's Ajantis mod, so if Ajantis is installed, the &quot;Temple Thievery Alternative&quot;
    component will not be installed.</p>
  <p>Both new Chapter 2 options begin after Valen and Brus make their traditional appearances.
    To begin the &quot;Paladin Route,&quot; visit the Government District after speaking
    with Brus. To begin the &quot;Assassin Route,&quot; go to the Slums, where a garishly
    dressed nobleman by the name of Malficus will make an attractive offer. He
    is standing outside the Copper Coronet, not far from the road that leads
    to the southern entrance to the Slums. </p>
  <p>Once the protagonist has committed to performing the first task of the &quot;Paladin
    Route,&quot; by paying the gold, all other paths are disabled, but it is possible to do two of the
    three tasks Malficus sets before you and then change sides.</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that for recruiting Edwin, the PC needs to work for Renal Bloodscalp long enough before accepting one of the alternative offers.</p>
  <p>To access the &quot;Temple Thievery Alternative&quot; options, speak to people in
  the temple about your concerns.</p>
  <p>If you would like to avoid killing Quallo's &quot;friend&quot;, you will see new options in Quallo's dialogue.
  <p>SUGGESTIONS: When one deals with dishonorable people, some treachery and
    double-dealing is only to be expected. Also, when embarking on a new venture,
    it is always advisable to tie up loose ends first. Thieves, especially, or
    those wishing to get to know <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/romanticencounters/" target="_blank">Renal
    Bloodscalp</a> a little better or recruit
    a certain <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/edwin" target="_blank">Red Wizard</a>, would be well advised to complete all thieves' guild
    tasks prior
    to going
    to the
    Five Flagons
    in or
    making any final arrangements with Malficus. The quest givers of both routes
    will warn you when you are approaching the point of no return.</p>
  <p>Comments: Yes, the &quot;Paladin Route&quot; is unoriginal. It was never intended
    to be otherwise, as it was designed for the protagonist who wants to go in,
    get the job done, and get out without compromising his morals along the way.</p>

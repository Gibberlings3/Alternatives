@2    = ~Yes, I know, but do you want me to kill that crawler over there to gain it?~
@3    = ~Never mind.~

@5    = ~Great, so should I kill you now, or what?~
@6    = ~Blood of a true friend... Guilt will leave its stain if you wish to have the blade.~
@7    = ~But guilt is a wide term. Cut me and I'll bleed...~
@8    = ~You are offering your own blood? That is gracious. I will try not to make the wound too deep...~
